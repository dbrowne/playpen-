#Dwight Browne's C++ Playpen


### Updated Daily (or so I hope) with various C++ tidbits that might be useful

- This will contain C++ 20 code and will be compiled with [gcc-11](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/changes.html).
- Tests will be made with [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
- There will be some [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) specific quirks but that is life.
- Instruction for adding Google Test to Clion can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/creating-google-test-run-debug-configuration-for-test.html).
- More updates to come
